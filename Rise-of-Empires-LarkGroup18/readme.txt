Name of game: Rise of Empires

Developed by: Landon Johnson

Narrative: You are the leader of a new empire and find yourself in the middle of an intense battlefield. 
Enemies approach as you aimlessly attempt to respond. 
To be victorious, you must build and train your civilization. 
By upgrading your means of production, you can improve the economy and gain respect for your people. 
Once you have built shelter for your troops, you can begin training your army and amass a fearsome force. 
When you are ready, attack other civilizations for a chance to win resources. 
Be careful, as each attack brings casualties and defeat will lessen your empire's resources.

Instructions: Use ls to see the contents of a directory
Use cat to read a file's contents, such as info for your buildings 
Use ./ directly before a filename to execute it (note: only files ending in .sh will be executable in this game). Ex: ./filename.sh
Use cd (stands for change directory) to change to a directory (in blue), such as to build or upgrade. Use cd .. to exit a directory. 
Use build and the name of a building to create it. The build directory contains building costs and other information
Use upgrade and the name of an upgrade to enhance your buildings. The upgrade directory displays available upgrades and costs
Use attack and an empire name when you're ready to battle for resources. The attack directory contains civilization names
Use train with a troop type to build your army. The train directory contains troop types and costs
Use the up and down arrows to search or repeat your previous commands
Use the directions function (just type directions then enter) to view these instructions while in the game
Note: It is recommended to play with green text as that is what I based my colors off of
Enter . start.sh to begin the game
